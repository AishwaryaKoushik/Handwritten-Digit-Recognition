# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
A Handwritten Digit Recognition model is trained using the MNIST Dataset

Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. This is a hard task for a machine because these digits are not perfect and can be visually dissimilar. The handwritten digit recognition is a one-stop solution to this problem.

The handwritten digits have contrasting sizes, widths, orientation ets as they differ from writing of person to person. So, the primary glitch would be to recognise and classify these digits despite the differences and similarities between digits such as 1 and 7, 5 and 6, 3 and 8, 2 and 5, 2 and 7, etc. Lastly, the uniqueness and variety in the handwriting of different individuals also influence the formation and appearance of the digits. Therefore, an algorithm is developed that helps the machine in identifying and classifying the digits irrespective of these discrepancies.
