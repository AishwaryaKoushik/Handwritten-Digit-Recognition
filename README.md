# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition


Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. This is a hard task for a machine because these digits are not perfect and can be visually dissimilar. The handwritten digit recognition is a one-stop solution to this problem.

The handwritten digits have contrasting sizes, widths, orientation ets as they differ from writing of person to person. So, the primary glitch would be to recognise and classify these digits despite the differences and similarities between digits such as 1 and 7, 5 and 6, 3 and 8, 2 and 5, 2 and 7, etc. Lastly, the uniqueness and variety in the handwriting of different individuals also influence the formation and appearance of the digits. Therefore, an algorithm is developed that helps the machine in identifying and classifying the digits irrespective of these discrepancies.

**Dataset**


The MNIST Dataset is used to train and test the model. The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The black and white images from NIST are normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced gray scale levels. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing.

**Models Used**


Three different models are used to analyze and classify the above dataset 
  1. Support Vector Machine
  2. k-Nearest Neighbors
  3. Random Forest Classifier

**Results**
An index from 0 to 255 is specified. The corresponding MNIST image from the dataset is displayed. The algorithm displays the classified digit.
